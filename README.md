# DevOps
Demo DevOps setup project

This is a sample project created for self learning. In this project Jenkins is setup with Artifactory.
Folder `jenkins` and `artifactory` are containing sample plugins installed and can be removed.
Running `runjenkins.sh` and `artifactory.sh` within this code checkout will pull the Docker image and install on the local machine.
If a fresh copy is needed without or if there is a problem with the currently installed plugins simpley removing  `jenkins` and `artifactory` directories and restarting the artifactory and jenkins processes should do the trick.
